<td>Devopsdays is an <em>open event</em> for discussing all topics around improving the interaction between what is traditionally considered development activity and that which is traditionally considered operations activity.

This event is inspired by and a continuation of the conversation from <a href="/events/2009-ghent/program">Devopsdays Belgium 2009</a> As we put together an agenda, we are looking to *YOU* to help shape the event. The best way to ensure that you get the most out of this event is to make a proposal or suggestion about a topic in which you are interested!</td>

There are three ways to propose a session:
<ol>
	<li><strong><em>A proposal for a talk/panel</em></strong> during the conference part : there are 45 minutes slots that will have all people's full attention as everybody will be in that one room.</li>
	<li><strong><em>An Ignite talk</em></strong> that will be presented during the<a href="/pages/ignite-talks-format"> Ignite sessions</a>: these are 5 minutes slots with slides changing every 15 seconds (20 slides total) also presented to all attendees in one room</li>
	<li><strong><em>Open Space sessions</em></strong> : these subjects can be proposed during the openspace market place and don't require any preparation upfront. You can send them now, but you don't have to as you will get the chance during the conference. <a href="/pages/open-space-format">Want to know more?</a></li>
</ol>
