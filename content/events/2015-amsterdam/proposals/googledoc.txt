Testing (micro)service based architectures is hard. Mocking/stubbing is an option, but the sheer difficulty of replicating datasets, traffic patterns, async response cycles and mocking other infrastructure make concerns multiply quite rapidly and logarithmically.

To combat this, there are release patterns like blue/green deployments, canary releases and A/B-testing to test whether our services are up to scratch and production worthy. Essentially, this means we are testing in production: one of the last taboos in the world! For companies like Netflix, Facebook but also Booking.com this an essential part of their online success and flows directly from their DevOps strategy.

This talk lays out the problem space and then focusses on the practicalities of such tests and how they work in a microservices and/or containerized world. Questions like what tech do you need and what steps you would take to get successful results are the core part.

Part of the talk will show our open source product VAMP (the Very Awesome Microservices Platform) tackles this problem. This talk is however not a product pitch and puts forward enough info and tips to take home regardless of implementation, language or specific infrastructure solution.

Speaker:

Tim Nolet is CTO and co-founder of Magnetic.io and has a 15 year background in online services and enterprise IT. Magnetic.io is currently gearing up for the open source launch of their product VAMP, also known as the Very Awesome Microservices Platform.

Tim is currently on a mission to reap all the benefits of the DevOps movement and loves playing around with  containers, Reactive Programming, streaming data and A/B testing.

I'm far from being an HR specialist; Even so, I've interviewed approximately 30 people for an Ops Lead role and couldn't find even one to stand up to my requirements. I've also heard of many (many) bad questions and wrong decisions made by interviewers because of which they didn't get the right person for the job. I would like to present the problem of why, in my opinion, it is hard to find that right person; why interviewers should stop looking for 'DevOps' and start looking for 'Good, Technical People' and why, after all, 30 people didn't suffice.

What is Docker and containers in general? Why they are so popular? How they differ from Virtual Machine?

I&rsquo;ll try to answer these and other related questions during my talk.

But the main focus of the talk will be on software testing and the improvements Docker can bring in this area.

To give you an idea I&rsquo;ll ask you few questions about software testing:


How to set up consistent testing environments?
How we can deploy the software quickly and consistently?
How we execute tests in parallel?
What are the easiest ways to reproduce found issues?
How do we test infrastructure including large-scale deployments, elastic scaling and other advanced capabilities?
How do we test microservices?



At the the talk I'll try to give some answers about the way Docker can help you addressing these challenges.

With the availability of multiple and efficient infrastructure management tools and solutions, the term Orchestration does not just define a procedure anymore.

In present days, Orchestration has a much wider definition starting from command blasting to ordered configuration deployment and many more. Different product vendors have defined Orchestration in their own ways and same is the case with users.

In this talk, we will go through an overview about Orchestration from a user, as well as a vendor perspective. The talk will include understanding of the term Orchestration in a wider scenario, each of the procedures or workflows which are defined by the term, a couple of examples about orchestration using tools such as Ansible and Salt.

Your ultimate goal is to bring new features faster to our end users. Yet &ndash; based on a recent study - you spend 80% of developer time in bugfixing resulting in $60B annual costs in 2014 alone. That means you only have 20% of engineering time for new innovative development.
In my opinion the reason for this disaster is the lack of automated quality control throughout the delivery pipeline. The good news is that most of the software and deployment problems can be detected early in an test automation. Why? Because ~ 80% of issues are only caused by about 20% of problem patterns, e.g: overloaded web pages, bad database access patterns, memory leaks, bad coding of algorithms or deployment configuration mistakes.
If you want to reduce lead time to bring the new cool features faster to your paying users you need to make sure you are not failing faster and then spending all our engineering power to fix these issues. In my talk I discuss 3 real life use cases of large applications that failed after a deployment, why they failed (technically deep dive) and which key software metrics these companies now look at in their delivery pipeline to stop bad code early on.

You&rsquo;ve defined the strategy, you&rsquo;ve changed the mindset and you&rsquo;re ready to implement DevOps practices. Now, where do I find these superstars, how do I convince them to join the journey and how do I retain their services?

One of the most difficult areas in the implementation of DevOps practices is finding exceptional people with the relevant skills who can put the strategy created into practice.

Huge amounts of organisations demand DevOps related skills, but there is a significant shortage, how do we set ourselves aside from the rest? Demand far exceeds supply, we need to ensure we are different.

ING is a dutch based financial institution. ING IT has always been considered a leading edge innovator in the Netherlands, being the first to introduce ATMs, internet banking etc. But our growth increased our bureaucracy, making the lead time to market longer and longer in a time when market conditions demanded shorter lead times.

After adopting Agile/Scrum as our development methodology we needed to make the transition to full DevOps cooperation to complete the feedback circle. And let development and operations take joint responsibility for production, together with the business.

Two years ago we embarked on this journey, transforming our entire IT department into small self organising DevOps teams with a lot of autonomy towards tooling. And with the goal of Continuous Delivery on the horizon.

How far have we come so far in our strive towards Continuous Delivery? And has it payed off? We see numerous highlights, but are they indicative for the whole organisation? And how do people feel about the transition?

In a first ever &lsquo;State of DevOps @ING&rsquo; survey (inspired by the State of DevOps survey 2014) among the staff I investigated these questions. This talk will focus on some of the results, combining them with other sources like the number of incidents or failed changes:
 - does the staff understand the transition and agree with it?
 - do we like working in DevOps teams?
 - how far are we really on our path towards Continuous Delivery?
 - are teams that are closer to reach Continuous Delivery Nirwana also more succesful?

Speaker:

Jan-Joost stumbled into IT almost 20 years ago, starting on a temp job for 5 days that lasted 7 years. During those years he has been mostly on the functional/process side of things, having worked as tester, designer, information analyst, project manager, application manager, change manager and currently as process owner the ITIL change management process at ING.

He is also the self appointed DevOps evangelist and community leader there, trying to help his co-workers to make the transition to DevOps and Continuous Delivery and have fun with it at the same time!

In his spare time he enjoys travelling the world to watch birds, or cooking, but rarely at the same time.

When I joined aerlingus.com as a consultant, I was first member of team that was tasked to migrate aerlingus.com to Amazon cloud. AerLingus is Irish national air carrier, ex-government owned, now public company. Around 75% of company sales go through that site, which is around 1.2 B EUR/year. Current site relies on bunch of legacy technologies (Solaris, IBM mainframe, etc...). There was 0 lines of documentation about anything and there was no drive nor understanding from management to do devops. Still in a year time we managed to establish some devops procedures. Main things that I would like to illustrate in this talk is
-Enterprises are not complex and unique, but alike

-It is possible to do enterprise devops, side by side with ITIL
-It is possible to sell devops to organization from within, simply because it works
-It is possible to connect legacy and new, we have direct connectivity between mainframe and Amazon cloud
-Illustrate how we are using Kanban as main methodology for collaboration between teams and how we convinced organization to use it

I would also like to illustrate key mistakes we made:
-To some extent you can sell devops to organization from within, but to really do it you need to have organizational drive
-Silos still continued to exist

Agile teams have become mainstream. Many managers consider setting the next step and scaling Agile in their organization. Scrum and Kanban are considered to be for team level Agile. Frameworks like the popular Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), the Spotify model and &ndash;recently- Large Scale Scrum (LESS) provide solutions for implementing Agile at Scale. SAFe and LESS both are based on Scrum and try to apply Scrum and its values to a team of teams. Obviously the founders of Scrum, Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber, are also basing their scaling models on Scrum.

The Spotify-model is the exception, because it let Scrum go. Nevertheless all these models share a common foundation and partly even a common solution, when looking from a process point of view. These similarities makes that you can use them all as a source of inspiration for your scaling challenges. However, these models differ in their approach towards change and on their interpretation of Agility. And these differences makes that one model will suit your organization better than another. This talk will give you a brief introduction into these 3 models, their common grounds and their main differences. You will learn what model will be the most appropriate one for you to start studying, and you will learn an important lesson. It is all about Scaling Agile For Enterprises Right.

DevOps in the Enterprise
&ldquo;How do we deliver the right outcome at the speed the market demands?&rdquo; This is the question at the center of our DevOps journey. Most of the strategies and tactics that have been successful are well-known: learn and respond quickly from tight feedback loops with real customers, have self-organized and motivated teams share ownership of all aspects of their outcomes, and use high-value engineering practices that produce operationally excellent software that&rsquo;s able to build and deploy and perhaps even repair itself.
If you are starting up a new group, adopting these approaches as you learn to work together towards your new outcome is only a normal amount of challenging. But what if you have a going concern, an existing enterprise, that didn&rsquo;t grow up working that way? And what if those teams already have products in the field and work in their backlogs? How do you shift left and successfully transform culture, practice and attitudes?
IBM&rsquo;s Cloud unit&rsquo;s DevOps Transformation Team goes well beyond advocacy and evangelism, embedding educators, coaches and practitioners with teams prepared to improve. The program starts with selecting teams that are willing and committed to the transformation and kicks off with a 3 day boot camp for executives and managers to set expectations and assure alignment. This is followed by a series of developer boot camps where teams learn to use IBM Design Thinking to drive the right outcomes as well as various modern practices to improve speed of delivery and operational excellence while adopting a start-up culture to the way they work. Another service of the DevOps Transformation Team is providing a fully functional tool chain that teams learn to operate and can adapt to their situation. Practitioners and coaches remain embedded with the teams to help assure their success.

DevOps Analytics is a new method of analytics based on Big Data technology and Machine Learning. DevOps Analytics predicts trends and  the success of the upcoming releases before the coding of the release even starts. This gives a new insight in the validated learning idea of LEAN and new testing ideas for DevOps.

One of the key elements of DevOps is continuous testing. To optimize testing, automation is essential. However, you do not know how successful the system actually is, unless it&rsquo;s based on experiences of users. The latter is needed to power the learning cycle in DevOps.
Tangible data tells us about, performance, production, number of errors etc . Non tangible data is about  experience, feelings, surveys and all non-structured information like tweets, logfiles etc. DevOps Analytics gives us the possibility to find trends and relationships in the tangible and non tanglible data
Our talk is about the possibilities and the implementation of DevOps Analytics to analyze data (BigData) to extract the users actual experiences on the functional and non-functional level. By using machine learning, the algorithms improve themselves every release. This results in a quick feedback loop to the DevOps team, making sure that every release is an improvement.

You want to implement DevOps ideas in your team? Then be aware that
implementing DevOps means a lot more than just changing the general set-up of the actual organization of the work. It demands lots of changes in personal behaviour and attitude - first of all by the initiator!
Besides powerful arguments it is of an absolute importance to convince others of the necessity of the personal change! So you &ndash; as the initiator &ndash; have to think about punchy arguments as well as reflecting yourself &ndash; and all this before integrating the whole team!
With starting your own personal changes you will also commence a viral process in your team. Your own attitude, your way of communication or your attempts to recognize other people&acute;s points of view are possible sources for your own change. Sooner or later multipliers will follow you step by step and help you to spread out your ideas! A motivational loop will start and will reach more and more people.

In this session you will learn:
-   which questions you will have to ask yourself before starting the personal change
-   why personal changes need time to grow
-   why leading people to change is much more efficient than pushing them to change
-   how you will identify different roles of all stakeholders in a team
-   how you will make multipliers work for your ideas
-   how to deal with &ldquo;NoNos&rdquo;
-   how this smart way of personal change management will have a motivational effect on you and your team
-   that it will also work if your are not &ldquo;the big boss&rdquo; in the team

But most of all you will learn that there always has to be someone to start with the change &ndash; YOU!

This talk will dig deep into the process of continuous integration (CI) and the key processes that make up the overall CI process.  We will discuss the relationships and process flows between change management, configuration management, and release/build management and how the CI process, when coupled with a solid performance engineering discipline across the product lifecycle, can result in a better user experience for your web &amp; mobile application.  We will speak about the entire lifecycle, the 'conveyor belt' of the application lifecycle, with concentration on the 'Big 3' processes that support the overall CI strategy.

We will include a real-world example of how SOASTA uses Jenkins and other open source solutions for its 'conveyor belt' and how this process enables SOASTA to complete over 100 product releases in 2014 and still maintain its customer SLA's for its Saas product offerings.

Testing or quality control for any product or a service offering is as critical as developing the product / service offering itself.  Additionally, achieving sufficient amount of testing to certify that the requirements are met with high quality or as per the quality criteria defined by the organization in a fast pace delivery model like DevOps is quite challenging.

This paper address the experience of adoption of the DevOps by the FVT and SVT teams &ndash; in terms of their perception, best practices and methodologies that have been adopted to achieve sufficient amount of testing in DevOps model and hence their inherent benefits which can be a great reference point for teams looking to adopt to this model.

Are you frustrated at work, unable to get everyone to see the obvious? Are you blocked by political machinations, incompetence, sloth, or the embodiment of other human failings? I&rsquo;ve here to give you the good news: it is probably your fault, which means you can do something about it.

Like most people you probably suffer from Skilled Incompetence. Skilled, because you produce actions effortlessly and unconsciously; Incompetence because your actions generate outcomes other than what you want. Without being aware of it the strategies you enact generate the very mistrust and resistance that is the source of your frustration.

In this talk I will introduce the work of Chris Argyris, his models for understanding our action strategies, and tools that can help you understand your own behavior better, build trust with others, and to create better outcomes by seeking learning rather than winning.

Ultimately this talk will attempt to convince you to take up the challenge of changing your own behavior. Despite what you may espouse about wanting a learning culture your frustration is a signal that what you want is for other people to learn. Saying you are open to change is different than acting that way. I hope by the end of the talk you want to know the truth about yourself enough to put these tools into practice.

While it&rsquo;s easy to pay lip service to the idea of innovating by failing fast, humans are both neurally geared and financially incentivized to avoid failure. We&rsquo;ve all heard the tales of woe: blameless reviews that were anything but blameless, encouragement to work on an experimental project with punishment being the primary result of its failure, and the associated fear of doing anything new, speculative or untried. The results are simple: individuals, teams and companies that stagnate slowly.

So how can we create an environment that makes failing fast safe for the participants and their organizations?

In this talk, we&rsquo;ll cover key strategies for creating an environment that fosters rapid innovation in your organization, including:


Conducting effective and truly blameless project post-mortems
Building a corporate culture &amp; HR processes that encourage failing ''the right way''
Measuring the impacts of positive failure &ndash; and failing to fail &ndash; on your organization&rsquo;s bottom line



Attendees will leave this presentation with concrete strategies to conquer their own fear of failure, and how to help their organizations do the same.

Times during which Tech Support has mostly been about suggesting to turn things off and on again are over. Nowadays, for a lot of companies, customers are highly skilled professionals themselves and are therefore more demanding when it comes to paid services.

DevOps principles have been used in web application development for a couple of years now. They provide mechanisms to quickly respond to feature requests or bug reports and build better software. Mobile development, being a much younger discipline, is yet to develop these principles to a higher level.

In this talk, we'll show how we organised a state-of-the-art Android development process. We use a few well known tactics like Continuous integration, MVP, Git flow, Lint checks, Unit tests, multi-environment support, a Jenkins build server and others. Also, we created new solutions to assault Android problems, like an internal service for deployment and a few new Android libraries.

With this process, we're sure that all developers work to a standard level of quality, that all new features are tested by automated tests before going into production and that we always have a stable build on our hands. Our goal was to have a standard process, but also remain agile (just like Navy seals!) .

We'll wrap up with a few tips&amp;tricks, and point out a couple of problems we stumbled upon while implementing the process.

SDL Fredhopper has experienced a 10x-magnitude of growth in the past few years. Currently, SDL Fredhopper e-commerce services are delivered to around 400 customers through close to 3000 servers on our cloud environments. Operating such an environment is not an easy task as well as developing for it. To overcome the task, we started to realize we need to bring development and operations together. In this talk, we present how this unique journey started, discuss our challenges throughout the journey, how the accomplishments became possible, and how this journey continues.

The talk presents the following outline:


The Challenges: The journey began for us with pinpointing essential and fundamental objectives. What is a server definition from an operations and development perspective? What operations do we expect from a server? What operations the software itself should take away? What is our unit of deployment and development?
The Solution: We took in every challenge from operations perspective and turned it into a development responsibility. We explain how the challenges we identified explicitly present  themselves into the architecture of the products we develop. We present how we lifted the abstraction of a server from &ldquo;resource&rdquo; level to API level. We discuss how the unit of deployment from a physical server is turned into a unit of API for a server. In addition, we discuss how such deployment API facilitates operation of a cluster of servers in a natural way.
Diversity: We present how our approach is different from other common approaches. When we started our journey, we did not have a complete world view. On the way, we found out related work targeting the same objectives. We present how we differ from very well-known similar approaches, re-assuring of the approaches that we took.
Gains and Conclusions: We present how our journey has helped us to craft a unified development, deployment, and operation architecture to enable our service delivery. We present how such approach gives us benefits and removes the concerns and challenges that we started with.

'There are many definitions of DevOps. Depending on who you ask, you will get a different view of what DevOps is about - tooling, an extension of Agile, continuous delivery, multifunctional teams, culture change, cost reduction. In Europe, DevOps is seen as a work method rather than a strategic choice.

In this talk, I will present a different view on DevOps, based on its goals and intentions rather than its technical characteritics. The aim of this view is to create common ground between the technical and managerial responsibiities within an IT organization, and ensure that both areas can reap the benefits of DevOps '

My proposed talk will address #monitoringsucks in 2015, what this new fangled data science thing means, and what the tools of the future look like.

Ever since the #monitoringsucks trend kicked off a conversation about the state of monitoring tools in 2011, there has been a flurry of activity resulting in new solutions, improved tools, and applications generating tons of data. However, we are still faced with the same issues almost 4 years later. Alerts still generate far too much noise to be useful. Dashboards aren&rsquo;t actionable and require human interpretation. The volume of log, time series, and other data makes it difficult to collate, visualize, and interpret in the mythical single pane of glass. How do we definitively solve these problems?

Data science. Using advances in data science and machine learning that are already being applied to &ldquo;sexy&rdquo; problems at companies around the globe, we can finally reach a tipping point when it comes to #monitoringsucks issues. New data science  tools can pinpoint problems before they hit a static threshold, group alerts from a variety of sources into a single logical error, and prevent eye strain from studying hundreds of graphs.

To be a data driven company, you can't be satisfied with measuring every tiny aspect and detail of your business or service, you have to be sure that the raw data is accurate. Assuring the quality or ever growing unstructured clickstream data is very hard though, espacially if the accountable team is your dedicated data team but the logs are written and produced by all other product teams.

We faced this problem recently and this is the way we tackled it: First, forget unstructured data, you can get sustainable quality only with structured logs. Then convince your fellow developers in the product teams about the importance of this project. Make the migration as smooth as possible by leveraging from the nature of structured data: provide tools that build upon the schema of the JSON logs, make monitoring and alerting automatic, so facilitating to sustain the quality of logs.

All in all, we focused on communication between teams, selling rather than telling, creating the demand on better quality data. Eventually all data team, product teams and the company won.

'A small number of modules usually contains most of the defects'

This is one of the seven principles of testing and has been proven by many past projects in the test reports. When we talk about Testing, two topics comes up, Black Box and White Box. These techniques are good to make sure the system meets their requirements. But what if you think different and outside of the Box by doing things are not in the requirements. ;) like type a large string in a small text box field, upload a corrupt file to the data base, try to access a privileged function with a normal user access or even send the same command to a server several times in a row? output definitively it will be different.

Error Injection is important to evaluating the dependability of computer systems, both Hardware and Software. This is a technique to improve coverage of a test in particular to error handling, recovering, tolerance and auto-reparing of a system. It's often used in stress and load test. Errors can be injected in Software, Hardware and Service procedures environments. There's not a magic recipe for doing a full test coverage.

Having a DTAP (Development, Test, Acceptance and Production) environment is a very common setup that a lot of companies use in their software development process. While this setup maps perfectly to waterfall development, it doesn't really fit when used in a Continuous Delivery and DevOps environment. A lot of tests run automatically and often cause  concurrency problems since they all run on the same machines. Test data management is becoming difficult since you need to satisfy all tests with one set of test data.

Meanwhile, technologies like Docker, cloud based computing and Infrastructure as Code change the rules of the game. Instead of having a supply-based infrastructure, you can quickly and in a cheap way create a demand-based infrastructure where you provision environments on the fly, which greatly reduces complexity and concurrency problems.

This session covers the rationale behind DTAP and we'll see how good of a fit DTAP is in a Continuous Delivery and DevOps environment. We'll take a look at proven patterns in software development and apply these using technologies like Docker and cloud based computing in order to reduce complexity go from a supply-driven infrastructure to a demand-driven infrastructure.

Through intense collaboration, the right tools and a good mix of automation, we were able to develop a DevOps pipeline that was not only able to consume new builds as fast as development could churn them out, but also do a baseline level of testing to ensure those builds were release candidates to the wider test floor. Hear how we tamed the beast and developed a process and infrastructure that is now being deployed to multiple other areas in the organization!

As Gartner predicts, by 2017 about 75% of IT organisations will have bimodal capability with about half making a mess. The type of business application is crucial to decide on the best application delivery strategy. IT Organisations need to build capability to support multiple methodologies and still have end-to-end traceability and control. This requires a Lean Application Delivery approach.

This session will talk about Lean Application Delivery, how it supports bimodal, and what they key capabilities to focus on.

Bol.com opened its doors on 30 March, 1999. Almost 16 years later bol.com is the largest (web)shop in the Netherlands and Belgium and market leader in the field of online sales of books, entertainment, electronic devices and toys, with over 5 million active customers and 900 employees.
Over the years bol.com has grown fast and steadily and the in-house IT department has been a powerful driver of innovation. To support our business with a short time to market and parallel progress in all key business areas, we started working agile in 2009. And to take all things necessary for growing further in our own hands, last year we build our own datacenter and insourced all web operations capabilities.
But when you&rsquo;re growing you have to deal with growing pains: too many teams working in the same code, too many dependencies between development and operations, releases getting bigger and buggier, and the risk of frustrations getting out of hand. And with our ambition to grow more than 200 people every year, that&rsquo;s not risk but a certainty.
So last summer we started &ldquo;Man on the Moon&rdquo;, our program to ensure scalability, productivity and motivation. Our goal is to help our teams to become independent &amp; autonomous while delivering a continuous flow of new functionality. Putting a Man on the Moon is not just a program: it requires boldness, creativity, inventiveness and commitment of everyone in the organization. It&rsquo;s a technical challenge and a cultural one as well. And it requires lift: of teams wanting autonomy, trust and tooling to fly their own mission.
In the program we focus on 3 things:
-   You build it, you run it, you love it: development teams pulling in operational run responsibility and eliminating dependencies that hold them down, one-by-one
-   Building a self-service &amp; self-scaling platform to help us grow
-   A new IT organization that enables autonomy and combines build &amp; run responsibility

At this moment some teams are still on earth while others are preparing their landing on the moon. We redesigned the IT organization, gained scalability and boosted motivation. Releases are getting smaller and the number of incidents is dropping. We&rsquo;re not there, but as with so many trips: the journey itself is as much fun as reaching the destination, so we have a great story to share about everything we did, messed up, learned and gained on the way.

Speaker:

Frederieke Ubels has been working for bol.com for 10+ years. She started as the manager of the book department, and switched to IT in 2007. Her background in the marketing department has played a key role in aligning the IT organization with the business departments within bol.com. As a Director IT Innovation she is responsible for continuous improvement of the innovation process at bol.com, alignment with business departments and for the transition to a DevOps way of working, to ensure scalability of the IT organization. This helps bol.com grow, stay ahead of the competition and hold its leading role in (e)commerce in the Netherlands and Belgium.

William de Ronde joined bol.com 10 years ago. In the years since, he did a full Tour of Duty in IT: as a developer, project manager, manager technology and head of operations. His experience combined with his gut feel way of working made him the best candidate to lead the migration to bol.com&rsquo;s newly built datacenter in 2014. Now that that&rsquo;s completed very successfully, he&rsquo;s the IT Innovation Manager helping the IT organization to stay on the edge by constantly motivating every engineer, manager and director to get the most out of themselves.

'What&rsquo;s next after lean/six sigma, agile development and continuous delivery? These methods make you do things right (effective and efficient), but what makes you do the right things? Agile starts with a vision and a filled product backlog, but how does it get filled and where does it come from? Hence the title &lsquo;Agile has no brain&rsquo;.

Here is where the next thing comes in: continuous service discovery. This closes the complete life cycle from service discovery, development and delivery to service retirement. It can be done by collaborative cross-functional teams. With continuous service discovery your organization is capable of constant innovation. Lean Startup and Design thinking methods are used to achieve this. How it all fits together is going to be published in a book called &lsquo;How to Build a Sequoia&rsquo;.

The aim of continuous delivery has always been to reduce risk by increasing the rate of feedback. Its predecessor continuous integration had the same goal and lead to the development silo swallowing the testing silo. Continuous delivery, by way of the devops movement, is now taking the next step: development is swallowing operations. This has lead to the emergence of so called 'full stack' developers; developers who claim to be able to do the dev and the ops.

But the stack is not full. As software becomes bigger and more complex, the only way to make useful software is with teams of software developers. Teams means soft skills, and they are conspicuously absent from most people's definition of 'full stack developer.'

In this talk I will explain why, to build cutting edge software, technical skills are simply not enough. All 'modern' software developers must be strong communicators, must display empathy for others and must be resilient in the face of criticism; skills that we hardly ever interview for, and that we almost never know how to develop in our staff.

This talk will be of interest to anyone who has a technically strong team who fail to perform, or anyone who spends too much of their working day in petty conversations about tool choices or any developers who want to know how to move into the upper echelons of their profession.

As our client - a global Telecoms organisation - embarked on their journey to adopt DevOps, the key question they asked of us was: &ldquo;How to practically Start?&rdquo;. Although an end-to-end view with a phased approach is always the consensus when implementing DevOps in an enterprise, the exact, practical starting point is always a debatable detail.

This case will present an approach to answer this important question (How to practically Start?) in a global enterprise where financial governance requires a benefits-driven approach to demonstrate business value and a business case to be approved.

We will talk about our experience &amp; insights in building a benefits case for DevOps based on tangible business value using methodologies like activity-based accounting and priority criteria to help identify a platform or project to be the &ldquo;point of launch&rdquo; for DevOps and then decide which phase in the IT lifecycle is best to start with first &ndash; ensuring the bigger picture of DevOps in the enterprise is not lost into the details.

Everybody is now taking about devops and continuous delivery, which is basically a means to get the software from idea to production as quickly (and often) as possible. So we get started right-away with a ''deployment pipeline'', but forgetting to put in place some proper configuration management. This talk will focus on managing application configuration.

So why do you need config management?

Before configuration management (in the context of the organization I was working at (which applies to many other organizations)):
- Incorrect application configuration leading to broken tests
- Stakeholders (Dev, Ops, QA, functional managers) have no clue what is running where
- Wastage of development cycle time

How did we go about it:
- Following the classic principle (to quote Jez Humble and David Farley in the bible on Continuous Delivery): ''Keep binary &#64257;les independent from con&#64257;guration information, and keep all con&#64257;guration information in one place.''
- An auto-discovering CMDB which provides realtime insight
- Making use of the Configuration management functionality of the automated deployment tool which we had bought

The results:
- Improved quality and reduced risks
- Quick changes without touching code
- Dashboard of version of software is running where
- Longer test timeslots became available
- Increased collaboration, everyone happier!

Speaker:

I have about 10 years of enterprise IT experience. I began my career as a Java web developer. After about 3 years, out of sheer curiosity I jumped the wall and took on the role of a deployment and hosting engineer.

As a 'configuration manager', I have been working the past 2 years (at a large airline company) along with application teams to implement configuration management, devops and continuous delivery.

Technology is progressing rapidly, new applications, new services that can change our way of thinking and can be a breakthrough for some companies who are adopting the technologies quickly and other hand rapid declining in growth for the companies who are slow or left behind.
From the evolution of the IT &ndash; business ecosystems we can learn a lot. Remember Novell or Apple and IBM in early days. They discover and some not that agility and more focus to a customer by making innovative services.
Nowadays we see with DevOps that time is for new relationship between business, IT and customers.
The demand &ndash; supply relationship is an obstacle to a new ideas, creativity and entrepreneurship.
The devops is one step to think about new organization structure that empowers knowledge sharing, collaboration, by using technology and faster execution power through Continuous development and deployment.
The DevOps is the first step through Continuous System Migration and Adaptation to Empowered organization structure where we all supply for the common purpose.
