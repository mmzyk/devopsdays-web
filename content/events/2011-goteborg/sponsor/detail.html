Devopsdays Goteborg October 14-15, 2011

Devopsdays are non-commercial community- driven events for people interested in helping develop and spread the ideas from the devops movement.

## The format
This year the Mountain View conference will be a two day event like its East Coast, European and Australian cousins.
Friday 17th
On the first day, we will have as last year's edition a mix between presentation, panel discussions and ignite talks sessions (program is currently being determined).
The public will be encouraged to interact with the speakers either by using microphones in the room or by using a “hot seat” format such as a “fishbowl”.
After the last session, participants willing to attend the second day will do a first round of proposals for the next day open-space.
Then we will call it a day and invite the participants for a social drink event to encourage further discussions and networking.
Saturday 18th
On Saturday we will mainly have an open-space (you can learn more about open- space here: http://devopsdays.org/pages/open-space-format/ ).
We will also have several “ignite demo” slots during the day allowing 10 minute long demos (time will be strictly enforced).

## Conference follow-ups
The event will be recorded, and we encourage participants to open-space to share and publish the result of their work.
Videos and ignite slides will be published online as soon as possible, and all materials, including blog articles and reference to the event will be linked from the devopsdays.org website for all to consult.

## Participants
Friday we have room for around 250+ people. Saturday we limit to 150 people.

Organization

## Process
Devopsdays being community events, we believe in keeping it free from commercial/vendor pitches and in keeping the proposal process as open as possible.
The criteria when selecting the proposals are to: 

- keep a good mixture between business, process, tools and integration oriented subjects 
- prefer actual war stories over conceptual only talks 
- promote ‘new’ content over recycled content 
- promote ‘new’ topics over traditional topics 
- ban commercial talks/vendor pitches (except during “ignite demos”)

## Sponsoring
This year again our main sponsor for Devopsdays Mountain View will be LinkedIn: they will be providing the facilities, event staffing (security, help with check-in, direct people to parking, etc.), video production, and lunch.
Still, we are looking for supporting sponsors to help us make this event even better by allowing us to: 

- keep the event free (or at the very least as cheap as possible for the attendees)
-  create awesome unique tshirts to give our attendees to wear proudly pay for breakfast for both days, Friday night drinks and appetizers cover miscellaneous costs including organizers travel costs
Sponsor package
We have a unique package for sponsors, with a cost of 1000 USD. As a sponsor you will be entitled to the following advantages: ●	logo on the website ●	logo on the published videos
●	mention during all official communication ●	shout outs during the day ●	tables to collect business cards and distribute flyers/goodies/marketing material
From the feedback gleaned from sponsors at previous conferences, we strongly advise our sponsors looking to hire to send technical staff and encourage this person to join the discussion.

If you have a product, you can present it during one of the 10 minute “ignite demo” on Saturday.
